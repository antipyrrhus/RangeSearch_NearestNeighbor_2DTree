This is a 2-D tree implementation to represent points on a 2-D plane, to allow for efficient range search (all points that lie in a given query rectangle) and nearest neighbor search (point nearest to a given query location).

To see a graphical representation, execute KdTreeVisualizer and click on any point in the GUI.

To perform a nearest neighbor search, execute NearestNeighborVisualizer with the name of any text file in the root directory (e.g. circle100.txt) as the parameter, and hover the mouse anywhere over the GUI. The nearest point will be highlighted dynamically.

To perform a range search, execute RangeSearchVisualizer with the name of any text file in the root directory (e.g. circle100.txt) as the parameter, and click/hold the mouse down over the gui to draw a rectangle. All points that lie within that rectangle will be highlighted.
